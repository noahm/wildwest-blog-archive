One can never leave till all the details are taken care of, but we didn't do too badly, were out of the driveway with the car filled with gas by 11:00 a.m. We listened to Odyssey (cassettes of stories for children) and The Door in the Wall. Made a few wrong turns but none that slowed us down much and got to North Little Rock Burns Park by 7:30 local time. The park was full of soccer players here for some kind of national championship. We couldn't connect the camper to the electricity because the source was way further away than the length of our camper electric cord. No problem--we just set the table up next to the outlet and cooked our chicken and dumplings in the electric rice cooker.

Two interesting factoids--there are some Indians camping here in a real tepee. They are the genuine article complete with motor cycles & trucks. The campground manager told us to be careful to put away all food because raccoons are a big problem, seems the Indians have had a problem keeping them out of the tepee because it's hard to seal up at the bottom. We noticed that they have chicken wire all around the bottom. The other interesting thing is I remembered this morning that I didn't bring any butter, but no problem, the cream that we brought for coffee had jiggled around so much that it had lots of butter around the edges. Amos, Ward, & John are playing on a small playground while I am writing this sitting at a park table in the shade. Nice way to start the day after a quiet and comfortable sleep.

This past weekend was haircut day for 4 of us. I like it short, one thing to not have to mess with, cooler, etc. The boys are somewhat of the same opinion except Ward (8), who complained throughout the buzzing. Since showering, no more complaints. Amos, getting ready for summer camp, sees the need for the haircut as well. John, who has never had a short haircut, was eager to have his cut. Now he looks like Amos, or what Amos looked like at 4. Yes, that is the after pix of John. If it were going to make us take our trip any sooner, John would have his hair completely removed. He is ever waiting to go.

The girls are getting their stuff together for making their trip, which starts in a week and a half.

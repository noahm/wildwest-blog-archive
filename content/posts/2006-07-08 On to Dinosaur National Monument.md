We woke up to a gentle rain on the camper, & John said he was thirsty. He scarfed down the water that we gave him, & almost immediately threw it up. After a backrub, he said he wanted to eat cereal. He seems fine now. We have just crossed the Continental Divide heading toward Dinosaur. We are in the clouds in Alpine tundra, on roads that seem to hang over the edge. The mantra is "Don't look, just drive, Dad!" There are poles ~10-20 feet tall placed at pretty close intervals all along this road. We presume that they are to mark where the road is so the snow plows know where to plow. There isn't a whole lot to make pictures of, but there are lots of little yellow flowers. Occasionally the mountains peek through the clouds, but Mary says this is obviously the end of the world because "if you stepped off the edge, you'd step into white nothingness."

If there really is nothing to take pictures of, we are all wondering why Eric is stopping the car every five minutes to take pictures! This is one of those days that would have been driving Noah crazy! Noah, be glad you aren't here today! On the western side of the mountains, the rain is continuing to follow us, and Dad has stopped for flowers, elk, & spectacular views. He says he doesn't know when he'll be out this way again & he should be able to take all the pictures he wants to. So be it.

We stopped for gas and coffee in Steamboat Springs, a town famous for ski resorts. There is apparently some sort of arts convention going on, but we don't have time to stop for it. There are tents set up with what look like artisans displaying their wares. Or perhaps it is a "leftover hippie" convention.

John keeps asking where are the dinosaurs. At Craig we stopped for groceries to tide us over the next few days. There are good deals on cherries (1.99/lb.) and some delicious-looking baseball-sized peaches (.88/lb.) If anyone knew my father, they will know that the last sentence sounds just like him! We see a sign shortly that says "No gas 57 miles," but we're prepared, this time. We finally pull into Jensen, UT a little after 9:00. Eric & the girls race off to make pictures of the desert sunset--a really nice one. Then we set up, eat a sandwich and fruit supper, and get ready for bed.

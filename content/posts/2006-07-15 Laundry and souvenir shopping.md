It's a pity that doing laundry gets its own entry, but with seven people vacationing for three weeks it is a time-consuming affair that must be dealt with. We drove back to the Old Faithful complex and found that there was a laundry in the Snow Lodge which we used for the next couple of hours. It was a good time for Ward and Amos to work on their Junior Ranger patches and everybody else wrote post cards. We got most of our souvenir shopping completed too. The shops everywhere seem to absorb too much of our time.

Lessons Amos and Ward have learned the last few days:

1. It is a foolish thing to lean against a pine tree because pine sap will gunk up clothes.
2. Hand sanitizer gets pine sap out pretty well.

Fortunately, there are no pictures of dirty laundry or of the gift shops.

By day, Red Rock Canyon was strikingly beautiful, especially so in the midst of Oklahoma's flatness. There were lots of rock climbers ready to enjoy the rock. We would like to have spent more time there, maybe another day.

Travel to Philmont Scout Ranch and Explorer Base to pick up the girls was pretty uneventful. We stopped in Amarillo for lunch. Gas prices rose as we traveled west. (Currently at $3.11 here in Cimarron) When we approached Philmont and Cimarron about 4:30 there were thunderstorms on the mountains which we watched dumping a solid wall of rain. We set up the camper amidst the puddles, but fortunately, the rain had subsided. We fixed dinner and went to Philmont's "opening" campfire (introduction to Philmont) at 8:30. They use staff to portray various people in the history of Philmont and northern New Mexico area. Came back to camper and went to bed.

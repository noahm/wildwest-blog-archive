It rained a good portion of the night, and the Colorado folks are saying they are so glad we Tennesseeans brought all this rain because they have been having a drought most of the spring making the fire danger quite high. Glad to help out any way we can! The girls think the rain followed them personally--it rained on them every day they were at Philmont except the first day (the extra day they had allowed & really weren't supposed to be there).

Spent the day doing laundry (Margaret), playing (kids), going to the movies and youth group at the Lorrigs' church (older kids), or trying to get a return phone call from a camper place (Eric). The gas option for the camper refrigerator has been having problems, and we are also wondering if we can get the fridge converted to a battery powered model. This would be preferrable to buying a cooler and having to constantly buy ice when not at a campsite with electricity. We spent the last part of the day at the local Walmart buying extra pants for Amos and Ward (didn't bring enough long ones if it stays this cool--highs have barely made it to 70), a lug wrench (YES!!), and a cooler--okay, the back-up plan is in place if we can't get the fridge going again.

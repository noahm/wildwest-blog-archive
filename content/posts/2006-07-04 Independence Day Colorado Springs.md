We had a breakfast treat at the Lorrig B & B--waffles with lots of whipped cream & fresh peaches, yum! We set up the camper & retrieved dirty laundry out of it. Kathy, Dave's sister, & her daughter Caitlyn came over for a brief visit. We went on a short walk at Garden of the Gods, the famous Colorado Springs city park with red rock formations. Then we went to the Flying W Ranch for dinner. It is a ranch that serves chuckwagon style dinners and has gift shops and other activities for entertainment before dinner. John & Ward (& the other kids too) participated in "chicken races." These consisted of three live chickens in plastic crates inside a low fenced area. For each round three kids got inside the fenced area and at the signal would lift the crates off the chickens and proceed to herd the chickens to the other end of the fenced area and recapture them in another set of plastic crates. The rules were they couldn't touch or hurt the chickens, but hands could be used to "shoo" the chickens. Then they gave everyone that partipated little American flags.

At the sound of the dinner bell, we had fifteen minutes to get inside to be served. The plan of choice is dinner outdoors, but once again, rain was pouring, and they are prepared to move everything inside. It was a really good meal of BBQ beef or chicken, baked beans, Dutch oven biscuits, apple sauce, baked potatoes, & spice cake. Since it was the 4th of July, they recognized all veterans & active duty servicemen in the audience. They also specifically recognized and presented appreciation plaques to five men from the four branches of the military and the fifth, a recently returned wounded veteran. This was followed by a country western musical performance by the Flying W Wranglers. It was enjoyable & one guy even told the old story of "Rindercella," ostensibly for the children. During the meal, John looked at the chicken on his plate, and said, "This is what I was racing."

We thought we might go to fireworks somewhere but came home & watched the rain & had light sabre fights (some were in the rain). John also pulled out his Frisbee with the light sticks and threw it outside in the darkness.

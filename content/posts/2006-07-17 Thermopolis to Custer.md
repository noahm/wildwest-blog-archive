All the kids went for a hot swim while I caught up on writing these blogs. (The last time I blogged was the first morning in Yellowstone. I plugged the computer into one of two outlets in the bathroom really early one morning sitting in a camp chair. The heat from the laptop was nice on that cold morning.) Now the shade of the bath house next to the mineral hot pool is very nice against the blazing sun here in this desert that promises another scorching day.

John and the others have come out of the pool and dried and changed. John is asking if we can please, please stay here another two or three days. He loves this pool and the trains. But we must go finish taking down and be on the road again.

Dusk found us in a nearby Dakota-mart buying ice and groceries. Custer State Park was a really beautiful park when we finally got there, once again an after dark arrival.

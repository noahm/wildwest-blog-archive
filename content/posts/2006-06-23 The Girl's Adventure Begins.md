Ellen and Mary left this morning with their Mom and brothers Ward and John to drive to a friend's house in central Illinois. After visiting and spending the night there, tomorrow morning Margaret will drive the remaining 50 miles to Lincoln where Ellen and Mary will board an Amtrak for Kansas City. The plan is to meet the rest of their cavalcade crew there who are coming from MN. From Kansas City, the train will take them to Raton, NM where they will board a bus to Philmont. It was kind of interesting, when I asked Amtrak what would happen if they missed their connection in Kansas City. Amtrak said that depending on how late, either they would put the girls in a hotel and put them on a train the following night, or if they hadn't missed it by much, they would put them on a bus that would catch up with the train. Makes me wonder about how fast train travel is.

Shown is the parting picture of Ellen and Mary (Ellen, left).
